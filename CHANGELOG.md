## Version 4 - Add ability to hide comics
Tranforms the add button into a hide comic button. This is to help you ignore comics that may constant pop up during exploring.

## Version 3 - Use GM_addStyle
Using GM_addStyle, instead of manually editing stylesheets, a new style sheet is injected in for more ease and efficiency.

## Version 2 - Tidy up the empty space
Empty space is left from hiding the selected readers. Condenses the area (so instead of profile height, it's progress bar height) and expands the progress bar horizontally to make use of the whitespace.

## Version 1 - Remove Selected Readers
Comic Rocket adds various user's profile pictures every comic serial as "Selected Readers". Remove them.
