## Version 2 - Tidy up the empty space
Empty space is left from hiding the selected readers. Condenses the area (so instead of profile height, it's progress bar height) and expands the progress bar horizontally to make use of the whitespace.

## Version 1 - Remove Selected Readers
Comic Rocket adds various user's profile pictures every comic serial as "Selected Readers". Remove them.
